# Manjaro-Splash-Blue

This is my own take on the Manjaro KDE splashscreen.
The theme of my Desktop is blue and I wanted the splashscreen to 
be blue as well.

I used the manjaro-logo and loading bar from here: https://store.kde.org/p/1296444/
and simply modified the color to fit my PC theme.

I then added the logo and load bar to this currently existing splashscreen https://store.kde.org/p/1295753/ and replaced the one that come with the original splashscreen. Here are a few screenshots:
